The user wants to build a modern Legal Tech Web Application called HukukAsistanım for the Turkish market. The user has provided a comprehensive architectural specification, including a detailed project structure, a full Prisma database schema, and specific code for key components.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide React, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Prisma, and Clerk for authentication.
2.  **Critical Initial Instruction**: Use **MOCK DATA** for all backend and authentication features. The immediate goal is to build a functional UI without connecting to a real database or auth service. Data should be managed in the frontend (e.g., local state, localStorage).
3.  **UI-First Priority**: The development priority is to build the core user-facing features first:
    *   The Dashboard.
    *   The Split-Screen Petition Editor.
    *   The Consumer Arbitration Wizard.
4.  **Theme**: The application should use a color theme of White, Navy Blue, and Orange.
5.  **Language**: The UI must be in Turkish, while code comments should be in English.
6.  **Phased Development**: The user is providing instructions in a phased, step-by-step manner for each module. The agent must follow these prompts exactly.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish (Türkçe). The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a Next.js application built with a white, navy, and orange theme, following the user's specifications. All data is currently mocked and state is managed on the frontend using React state and , per the user's instructions.

The following modules have been implemented:
1.  **Petition Generator ()**: A fully functional module with a split-screen editor. The left panel contains a dynamic form generated from mock data, and the right panel shows a live A4-style preview of the petition. It supports 3 different petition templates, and user-generated petitions are persisted in .
2.  **Risk Analysis Module ()**: A complete multi-step wizard that allows users to assess legal risks for two scenarios: Kira Anlaşmazlığı (Rental Dispute) and İşçilik Alacağı (Labor Rights). It features a custom calculation engine that provides a risk score (0-100), a color-coded risk level, and actionable recommendations. Results are saved to  and displayed on the main dashboard.
3.  **Dashboard ()**: A central page that displays summary statistics and lists recent petitions and risk analyses by reading data from .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was working on **AŞAMA 3: UI Components** for the **Tüketici Hakem Heyeti (Consumer Arbitration) Module**. It successfully created all the required React components for the wizard interface.
-   **Status**: **IN PROGRESS**
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (via screenshot of a test page rendering the components)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. The next step is to assemble these components into a full-page wizard. Once that is done, the frontend testing agent should be used to test the complete flow.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The work is proceeding as planned.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Complete the Tüketici Hakem Heyeti (Consumer Arbitration) Module.
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent just finished AŞAMA 3 (creating UI components). The next step is **AŞAMA 4: Main Wizard Page**. This involves creating the page  that will use the  hook and the newly created UI components (, , etc.) to build the complete, multi-step wizard experience.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional, multi-step wizard for generating consumer arbitration applications. The user's progress and final application data will be saved to .
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None. Waiting for the user to provide the prompt for AŞAMA 4.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0: Consumer Arbitration Module - AŞAMA 5: Dashboard Integration**: After the wizard is functional, it needs to be integrated into the main dashboard () to show recent applications, and a link should be added to the navigation.
-   **P1: Case Law Search Module ()**: Implement the search and filter interface for Supreme Court decisions as specified in the original master prompt.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Backend Integration**: Migrate from mock data and  to a real backend. This involves:
    -   Connecting to the Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.
    -   Implementing all Prisma models defined in .
    -   Replacing frontend data fetching with server-side logic and API calls.
-   **Authentication**: Integrate Clerk for user registration and login, replacing the current mock user setup.
-   **Server Actions**: Implement the server actions (, , etc.) to handle CRUD operations with the database.
-   **PDF Generation**: Implement a robust PDF generation feature using  to replace any temporary solutions like .

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Project Scaffolding**: Initialized Next.js project and configured Tailwind CSS with a custom theme (white, navy, orange).
-   **Petition Generator Module**: Built a fully functional split-screen editor with live preview for 3 mock petition templates. Data persists in .
-   **Risk Analysis Module**: Built a complete wizard for 2 risk scenarios, including a custom calculation engine, UI components, and integration with the main dashboard. Data persists in .
-   **Consumer Arbitration Module (In Progress)**:
    -   Created mock data and TypeScript types (, ).
    -   Created a custom state management hook ().
    -   Created all necessary UI components ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1**: During the initial build (Msg 27), the agent noted a browser issue when attempting to test the Save and Download PDF function for the petition generator. It did not investigate further, as the focus was on UI development with mock data. This functionality will need to be properly implemented and tested during the backend/PDF generation phase.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (, , , ), custom hooks for feature-specific logic.
-   **Data Persistence**: Client-side  is used to mock database persistence for petitions, risk analysis results, and arbitration drafts.
-   **Development Strategy**: Phased, UI-first development using mock data, as directed by the user.

**key DB schema**
The database schema has been defined in the user's prompt but is **not yet implemented**. The planned models are: , , , , , , , .

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the mock data for the two risk analysis scenarios.
-   : The calculation logic for the risk analysis module.
-   : Contains the detailed configuration and mock data for the 5-step consumer arbitration wizard.
-   : TypeScript type definitions for the arbitration module.
-   : The custom React hook for managing the state of the arbitration wizard.
-   : Directory containing all UI components for the arbitration wizard.
-   : Directory containing the pages for the risk analysis wizard flow.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Follow User's Phased Prompts**: The user is driving development by providing detailed, step-by-step instructions for each module. Adhere to these instructions strictly.
-   **Mock Data First**: The project is in a UI-first, mock-data phase. Do not attempt to connect to a real database (Supabase) or authentication service (Clerk) until explicitly told to do so. All data persistence is currently handled via .
-   **Language**: You MUST respond in **Turkish**.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.
